## Audio Implementation

The website is designed to work even without these audio files. The JavaScript code includes error handling for cases where audio files might be missing or cannot be played.

To add real audio files:

1. Obtain appropriate audio files with proper licensing
2. Convert them to MP3 format for broad browser compatibility
3. Keep file sizes small (ideally under 1MB each) for fast loading
4. Replace the placeholder files in this directory

## Audio Controls

The website includes volume controls and mute options for user convenience. Background music is set to play at a low volume by default and can be muted by the user.
